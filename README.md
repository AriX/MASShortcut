# MASShortcut

This is a fork of the [MASShortcut project] (https://github.com/shpakovski/MASShortcut). It contains enhancements to the MASShortcutView class, making it feel more like a native button, and using images to make the control more intuitive and self-explanatory.

This version of MASShortcut is non-ARC (retain/release), and works on 10.6+.
